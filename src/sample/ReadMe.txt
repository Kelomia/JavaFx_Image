This project is developed on IntellJ, some parts were build by it.
The two .java file, "Flags.java" and "Tictactoe.java", could run itself to Display images OR
 Show Tic-tac-toe game.

Flags:
The picture of Canada's flag is not in the file that the books mentioned. So the output pics is
 not the same as that in the question.

Tic-tac-toe:
The final out put picture is set in the code, which will not change.
